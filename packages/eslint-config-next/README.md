## ESLint Configuration

Hey ðŸ‘‹ thanks for checking out my ESLint configuration. I use this ESLint configuration file for projects using:

- Prettier
- Typescript
- Jest
- NextJS

### Getting Started

Install the dependencies

```
yarn add --dev @mitchbne/eslint-config eslint prettier typescript jest
```

It is already assumed that you have the following packages already installed, but if you haven't, you can install them with:

```
yarn add react react-dom next
```

Add this to your ESLint configuration file:

```
{
  "extends": "@mitchbne/eslint-config"
}
```
